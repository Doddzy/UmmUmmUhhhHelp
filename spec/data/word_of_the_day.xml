    <strong>Did you know?</strong><br />
    <p><em>Woolgathering</em> once literally referred to the act of gathering loose tufts of wool that had gotten caught on bushes and fences as sheep passed by. As you might imagine, woolgathering was not the most profitable of enterprises; its practitioners must have seemed to wander aimlessly, gaining little for their efforts. In the mid-16th century, <em>woolgathering</em> began to appear in figurative phrases such as "my wits went a woolgathering"—in other words, "my mind went wandering aimlessly." From there, it wasn't long before the word <em>woolgathering</em> came to suggest foolish or purposeless mind-wandering.</p>

    <strong>Did you know?</strong><br />
    <p><em>Rabble</em> has been with the English language since its appearance in Middle English (as <em>rabel</em>) around the turn of the 15th century. The Middle English <em>rabel</em> (originally used to denote a pack or swarm of animals or insects) may have come from the verb <em>rabel</em> which meant "to babble" (despite the similarity in sound and meaning, however, <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/babble"><em>babble</em></a> and <em>rabble</em> are linguistically unrelated). The verb <em>rabel</em> is related to Middle Dutch <em>rabbelen</em> and Low German <em>rabbeln</em>, meaning "to speak rapidly or indistinctly" or "to chatter." So how do we get from babbling to crowds of people? The connecting link may be the idea of confusion. <em>Rabble</em>, in its earliest uses, could indicate a pack of animals, a swarm of insects, or a confused collection of things, in addition to a confused or meaningless string of words.</p>

    <strong>nondescript</strong> &#149; \nahn-dih-SKRIPT\&nbsp; &#149; <em>adjective</em><br />
    <p><strong>1 :</strong> belonging or appearing to belong to no particular class or kind <strong>:</strong> not easily described</p>

  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Examples:</strong><br />
    <p>The famous spy was a quiet, <em>nondescript</em> man that people had a difficult time describing even a few minutes after meeting him, which was clearly an advantage in his profession.</p>

<p>"Crowds of tech aficionados, news crews and the simply curious turned out for the public opening of Amazon's checkout-free convenience store Monday, giving a generally <em>nondescript</em> sidewalk the air of an Apple store the day a new iPhone comes out." — Elizabeth Weise and Amity Addrisi, <em>The Dayton (Ohio) Daily News</em>, 23 Jan. 2018</p>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Did you know?</strong><br />
    <p>It is relatively easy to describe the origins of <em>nondescript</em> (and there's a hint in the first part of this sentence). <em>Nondescript</em> was formed by combining the prefix <em>non-</em> (meaning "not") with <em>descriptus</em>,the past participle of the Latin verb <em>describere</em>, meaning "to describe." It is no surprise, then, that when the word was adopted in the late 17th century by English speakers, it was typically applied to something (such as a genus or species) that had not yet been described. Other descriptive descendants of <em>describere</em> in English include <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/describe"><em>describe</em></a>, <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/description"><em>description</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/descriptive"><em>descriptive</em></a> itself, as well as the rare philosophical term <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/descriptum"><em>descriptum</em></a> ("something that is described").</p>

"Crowds of tech aficionados, news crews and the simply curious turned out for the public opening of Amazon's checkout-free convenience store Monday, giving a generally nondescript sidewalk the air of an Apple store the day a new iPhone comes out." — Elizabeth Weise and Amity Addrisi, The Dayton (Ohio) Daily News, 23 Jan. 2018

    <p><em>Agon</em> comes from the Greek word <em>agōn</em>, which is translated with a number of meanings, among them "contest," "competition at games," and "gathering." In ancient Greece, agons (the word is also pluralized in English as <em>agones</em>) were contests held during public festivals. The contests—among them the ancient <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/olympics">Olympics</a>, on which our modern Olympics is modeled—involved everything from athletics to chariot and horse racing to music and literature. <em>Agon</em> in the realm of literature refers to the dramatic conflict between the main characters in a Greek play or, more broadly, between the chief characters in any literary work. The word is also occasionally used to refer to conflict in general.</p>

    <p>Theological scholars have long been preoccupied with interpreting the meanings of various passages in the Bible.
